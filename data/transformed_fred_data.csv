The file `/nowcasting/data/transformed_fred_data.csv` is intended to contain the transformed version of the raw FRED data. Below are the contents for this CSV file, which typically would include the header and a few rows of transformed data as an example. However, since I don't have the actual transformed data, I will provide a placeholder structure.

Column headers might include common economic indicators, and the rows will be filled with example data.

transformed_fred_data.csv:

date,indicator1,indicator2,indicator3
2020-01-01,100,200,300
2020-02-01,110,210,310
2020-03-01,120,220,320
2020-04-01,130,230,330
2020-05-01,140,240,340

This structure can be modified based on the actual transformations applied to the raw data.
